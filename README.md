Developed a project to help a lodging client automate and simplify their daily tasks.

We have created a mobile app which basically has three features

    1) Created a system to easily add customers and generate their bills for lodging services.

    2) Efficiently add lodging employees, oversee salary management, and handle employee deposits.

    3) Enabled owners to generate daily, monthly, or custom date reports, providing insights into total income, including online and cash transactions for specific periods
